# Basics

## General principles

Принципы:

Потребности пользователей на первом месте
В основе всех решений лежат исследования
Обеспечение доступности сервисов для всех групп пользователей
Очевидность и ясность взаимодействия с сервисами
Постоянное развитие в связи с меняющимися потребностями пользователей
Мобильная версия важнее

First of all, let's define and disclose the [general principles of UX design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics) in order not to contradict them:

1. **Visibility of system status**

   Indicate loading of every single action, use skeleton views for pages

2. **Clarity**

   Describe actions and consequences exhaustively using only the simplest words and icons

3. **User control**

   Provide navigation with the ability to move forward and backward on all pages and functionality with the ability to undo and redo all actions

4. **Consistency**

   Use the narrowest and most rigorous list of styles, approaches and components

5. **Error prevention**

   Warn the user and avoid allowing him to do anything by mistake, hide from views and mark destructive actions red

6. **Visibility of everything the user needs**

   Remember that out of sight means out of mind and show user all actions, navigation destinations and only necessary information

7. **Flexibility**

   Create as versatile yet customizable interfaces as possible

8. **Simplicity**

   Remember that less is more, avoid using shadows, unnecessary borders, colors

9. **Error correction**

   Offer users an ability to edit and undo everything

10. **Documentation**

    Provide easy access to detailed description and explanation, help and support everywhere

Moreover, development of cross-platform interfaces these days requires to place a great emphasis on

11. **Functionality**

    Consider design to be able to hold a very large number of actions and navigation

12. **Accessibility**

    - Always preserve color contrast ratio and font size
    - Write semantic HTML
    - Declare language of site
    - Leave meaningful links
    - Add placeholders and alt texts

Examples of following practices include [targeting bottom of screen on mobile devices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages).

## Structure

**Layout** - whole page container that holds views, panels, etc

- **Bar** - small vertical or horizontal and sometimes fixed container of contents and controls placed near the edge of the view
- **View** - container with bars, controls and contents
  - **Box** - interactive or non-interactive element consisting of content, i.e. button, input etc
    - **Content** - simple element such as text, icon, image

**Navigation** - all what the user can do to move through different sections of the app without modifying any data

**Action** - all what the user can do, which is not navigation and which is represented by the content in the control

HIG divides elements into 3 clear categories - controls, bars, views, and I will stick to this terminology and expand it. By controls I mean buttons, input boxes and any other interactive components consisting of simple elements. Bars - panels, menus, and other components that are limited in size and consist of uniform controls. Views - pages or their fragments, unlimited in size and consisting of bars and controls.

MD's approach is untenable because it offers 3 primary colors, not counting the background, foreground and error ones. At a minimum, it is necessary to reduce such diversity, so as not to contradict the simplicity and universality.

HID just provides an array of pretty colors, and basically uses the main brand or OS theme color all the time, as well as some red error color. But, including the high-contrast colorscheme, there are 4 sets of color, and that’s too much in my opinion. Why not we make all colors contrast enough to avoid creating high-contrast theme?

Цвет в дизайн-системе — важнейший инструмент. У каждого цвета свои функции. От них нельзя отступать, чтобы сохранить целостность сайта и помочь пользователям интуитивно определять, какие действия можно совершить с помощью того или иного компонента. Например, перейти по ссылке или исправить ошибку в форме. Цвет также помогает расставлять акценты, выделять важную информацию, обозначать активные и интерактивные элементы.

## Dark mode

## Elevation

MD offers elevation, a way to visually separate elements. HIG does not have this, and thus shows that elevation is not necessary for clear and beautiful interfaces. Therefore, I will not use it either, so as not to contradict simplicity. In addition, the elevation in the light theme is done by shadows, and in the dark theme by colors, which to me contradicts the consistency.

## Sizing and spacing

Design systems for some reason usually give no recommendations about spacing elements.
Spacing should be based on the size of the elements. According to research https://uxmovement.com/mobile/optimal-size-and-spacing-for-mobile-buttons/, minimum tap target is around 42px; MD advices 48px, HID - 44px. To preserve versatility, I’ll reduce this number, since 48px tap target is great on mobile but often way too much for desktop mouse cursor. There are rules:
Any clickable element should be minimum 40x40px, than assumes 24x24px content (width may vary significantly) with 8px padding
Any small inner content such as icon or text should be 16px away from edge of screen, so
Such content or it’s parent container should have 8px padding
Any bar or non-fullscreen view container touching edge of screen must have 8px padding
Each children container can have padding and gap of same or lesser size;
Any component or container touching the parent view’s padding from the edge of the screen should have 8px padding to preserve 16px distance of content (text, icon etc) from edge of the screen.
