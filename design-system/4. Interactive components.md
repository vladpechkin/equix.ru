# Interactive Components

Since we are developing primarily for the web, it is worth starting with the implementation of all the interactive elements of html, considering the multifunctionality of `<input>`:

1. `<a>`
2. `<audio>`
3. `<button>`
4. `<details>`
5. `<img>`
6. `<select>`
7. `<textarea>`
8. `<video>`
9. `<input type="checkbox">`
10. `<input type="color">`
11. `<input type="date">`
12. `<input type="email">`
13. `<input type="file">`
14. `<input type="number">`
15. `<input type="password">`
16. `<input type="radio">`
17. `<input type="range">`
18. `<input type="reset">`
19. `<input type="search">`
20. `<input type="tel">`
21. `<input type="text">`
22. `<input type="time">`
23. `<input type="url">`
24. `<input type="submit">`
25. ~~`<input type="datetime-local">`~~
26. ~~`<input type="week">`~~
27. ~~`<input type="button">`~~
28. ~~`<input type="hidden">`~~
29. ~~`<input type="image">`~~
30. ~~`<input type="month">`~~

## Link

A component can have many interactive elements, often, to indicate interactivity it is enough to leave only one element colored, leaving the others black and white.

Don't make links consisting of 1-2 words like "click here"
Do meaningful long link labels
Because users want to clearly know where they will be taken if they click on link

Don't put links in the text
Do put a list of links from the page at the end so that the user goes to them after reading the page
Because user might be distracted from the main text and won't finish reading the page
