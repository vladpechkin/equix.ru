# Introduction

## Definition

*Design system* is a complete set of standards intended to manage design at scale using reusable components and patterns.

*User experience (UX)* encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

*Developer Experience (DX)* is the equivalent of User Experience when the primary user of the product is a developer.

## Problem

For some reason, there is no design system that focuses primarily on UX rather than UI beauty. *EQUIX (EQually UI and UX)* design system is created to solve this problem.

## Solution

EQUIX:
1. Cares about UX and DX and provides the most optimal solutions to typical tasks and their documentation, as well as carefully developed approaches based on researches and case studies;
2. Ð¡overs all phases of development from visualization to deployment of the product;
3. Allows to create interfaces for all major platforms - Android, IOS, Windows, Linux, MacOS, IpadOS;
4. Includes template solutions for all major types of applications - Website (Landing), Online Store, News Portal (Blog), Admin (Database manager);
5. Uses latest technologies to ensure high speed, functionality and fault tolerance of applications;

## Existing solutions

Two most common design systems, *Google's Material Design (MD)* and Apple's *Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)*, struggle with different problems for a while. MD is ugly to many of users, and, moveover, the direction of it's development contradicts to the UI/UX principles. HIG may look more attractive but contains even more inconsistency and bad decisions. The choice of other modern and freely distributed UI-kits is very narrow, and represented mainly by frameworks Bootstrap, Ant Design etc. Their main problem is that they are too stylized, not enough barebones, and therefore non-universal and difficult to develop something unique and nice-looking on their basis.

## Technical stack

EQUIX is based on:
1. [Material Design](https://material.io/) ideas, as the most widespread design system
2. [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) ideas, for the same reason
3. [Tailwindcss (TW)](https://tailwindcss.com) values, reduced for simplicity and consistency, because this CSS utility framework allows to create interfaces the fastest way and has extremely well chosen defaults
4. [Bootstrap icons](https://https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), because they aren't as bold and somewhat cumbersome as MD icons, and more complete and consistent than other non-proprietary icon sets
5. [NN/Group](https://nngroup.com) and other studies and researches sources
