## Snackbar

Snackbar is a simple component that acts as a notification and may hold 1-2 simple actions. It must:

- Be a rounded rectangle of background color with default border to be easily distinguishable from other interface elements
- Be located in a screen-wide or narrower container with a 16px padding and same margin to be easily distinguishable from other UI elements.
- Be located at the bottom of the screen to be easily reachable on the phone and easily distinguishable from other UI elements.
- Be located on top of any other elements to be eye-catching.
- Be displayed for 5 seconds or until the next snackbar appears, to give the user time to scan and react to its contents
- Not overlap navigational elements (e.g. bottom navbar) to give the user ability to leave the screen which caused the snackbar. If such ability is not needed, see [dialog](#dialog-and-sheet).
- Provide ~10 words of text and up to 2 actions, because otherwise the component is unformative and useless or too large and complex.

MD offers some kind of decorative view called backdrop:

Such view customizations have their place if they don't contradict design principles, but I don't see the point and would rather not use them to not contradict simplicity, consistency and versatility.

Same goes for book view that is offered by HIG.
