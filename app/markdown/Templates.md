# Loading indicator

### MD -->

MD offers 2 loading animations, and in my opinion first one is less versatile, so I would go with the second option, espesially considering the fact that it can be integrated in button, text and everywhere else.

### HIG

HID offers one simple indicator that agrees with the above.

### FD

That simple Bootstrap icon with spinning animation integrated in some control, bar or view is all what needed to display ongoing process anywhere.
